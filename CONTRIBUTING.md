All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

Submitting a Bug Report
When opening a new issue in the Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Legit-Info issue tracker, please provide as much detail about your environment as possible.

See How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example.

Triaging a Bug Report
Once an issue has been opened, it is not uncommon for there to be discussion around it. Some contributors may have differing opinions about the issue, including whether the behavior being seen is a bug or a feature. This discussion is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.

Short, clipped responses—that provide neither additional context nor supporting detail—are not helpful or professional. To many, such responses are simply annoying and unfriendly.

Contributors are encouraged to help one another make forward progress as much as possible, empowering one another to solve issues collaboratively. If you choose to comment on an issue that you feel either is not a problem that needs to be fixed, or if you encounter information in an issue that you feel is incorrect, explain why you feel that way with additional supporting context, and be willing to be convinced that you may be wrong. By doing so, we can often reach the correct outcome much faster.

Resolving a Bug Report
In the vast majority of cases, issues are resolved by opening a Pull Request. The process for opening and reviewing a Pull Request isa similar to that of opening and triaging issues, but carries with it a necessary review and approval workflow that ensures that the proposed changes meet the minimal quality and functional guidelines of the Project Sample project.

When contributing a major change to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue or via Slack in the #racial-justice-legit-info channel in the Call for Code Slack workspace. Minor issues can simply be addressed by sending by a pull request.

All pull requests will require you to ensure the change is certified via the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.

Please note we have a Code of Conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project and its community.
